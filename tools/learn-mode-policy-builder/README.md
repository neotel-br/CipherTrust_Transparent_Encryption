# Learn Mode Tool

`lmpb` is a Python-based tool for processing the CTE Learn Mode audit logs and generating security policies. Learn Mode allows access to guarded path while logging access details. This tool helps administrators understand the gap between the current policy and the required policy and suggest corrective changes. The CipherTrust Manager and file system administrators are advised to review the changes before pushing them to the CipherTrust Manager.

To collect logs that can be processed by the Learn Mode tool, enable the Learn Mode toggle on the CipherTrust Manager GUI while creating a policy. After you have logs for the Learn Mode, you can proceed as follows:

1. Clone the CipherTrust Transparent Encryption Git repository.

        git clone https://github.com/thalescpl-io/CipherTrust_Transparent_Encryption.git

2. Navigate to the `learn-mode-policy-builder` directory.

        cd CipherTrust_Transparent_Encryption/tools/learn-mode-policy-builder

3. View the common commands.

        ./lmpb -h

    **Sample Output**

        usage: lmpb [-h] [--logdir LOGDIR] {log,policy} ...

        positional arguments:
          {log,policy}
            log            cte learn mode logs
            policy         learn mode policy updates

        options:
          -h, --help           show this help message and exit
          --agent_os AGENT_OS  operating system where CTE is installed(one of `linux` or `windows`), defaults to `linux`
          --logdir   LOGDIR    log directory, defaults to /var/log/vormetric

        ./lmpb --logdir /home/logs/logs/ubu0/ log

**Sample Output**

    positional arguments:
      {status,process,report}
        status              logs status
        process             process logs
        report              print log report in text format

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit

View the log status:

    ./lmpb --logdir /home/logs/logs/ubu0/ log status

* If unprocessed logs are present, output will be as shown below:

    **Sample Output**

        Found 181 log files in /home/logs/logs/ubu0/ with unprocessed entries.
        Total size of unprocessed entries is 326.62 MB

* If all log files are already processed, output will be as shown below:

    **Sample Output**

        No new log entries in /home/logs/logs/ubu0/ since Mon Dec  5 17:34:39 2022

* For _processing the unprocessed log files_, run the command:

        ./lmpb --logdir /home/logs/logs/ubu0/ log process

    **Sample Output**

        Successfully parsed all log files
        Other log entries: 9, saved to /tmp/lmskip.340576
        Log output saved as JSON at /home/logs/logs/ubu0/output.json

    **Note**: The `output.json` can be input to Splunk to visualize the data.

        cat /home/logs/logs/ubu0/output.json | nc 10.171.56.220 6666

    Here, SPLUNK server is configured to listen on port `6666` for "json_no_timestamp" events. Here, `10.171.56.220` is just an example of the host IP where SPLUNK is hosted.

* For viewing the log report:

        ./lmpb --logdir /home/logs/logs/ubu0/ log report

    **Sample Ouptut**

    The output will show all processes, accesses performed by them, and the directories over which they have been performed.

After the logs are processed by the Learn Mode policy builder tools, following policy related commands can be run to list the existing policies or show updates recommended by the tool.

* Policies can be viewed based on users or processes. By default, it is user-based.

        ./lmpb --logdir /home/logs/logs/ubu0/ policy show --type user

* The output of policy show in this case will be sorted, based on user sets. This is the default setting for policy show command.

        ./lmpb --logdir /home/logs/logs/ubu0/ policy show --type process

* The output of policy show in this case will be sorted, based on process sets.

## Uploading Policy to CipherTrust Manager

* To upload the policy to the CipherTrust Manager, run the command:

        ./lmpb --logdir /home/logs/logs/ora policy upload --policy-name LEARMODE --type user --upload-name learn-mode-policy --domain domainname --cmaddr IP-ADDR-OF-CM --username admin --password PASSWORD

    **Sample Output**

        ./lmpb policy upload --policy-name learnMode --type user --upload-name LearnMode --domain root --cmaddr IP-ADDR-OF-CM --username admin --password password

        Uploading learn mode policy updates for learnMode using name LearnMode

The above command will upload a policy to the CipherTrust Manager with modifications on top of the original policy suggested by the Learn Mode policy builder tool. Note that the above command will fail if the original policy is not found on the specified CipherTrust Manager.
